## ‚ú® Features
- Creates and cleans a temporary **export directory**

## üìå Requirements
- Windows with Hyper-V role installed
- Run PowerShell as **Administrator**
- Access to the network share defined in `$backupPath`

## üöÄ Usage

   ```
   
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Backup-HyperV.ps1
   ```

3. All VMs with Backup_ in their name will be exported and copied to the backup location.
