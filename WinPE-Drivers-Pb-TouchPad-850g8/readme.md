## üîß Fix: Inject Drivers into WinPE

1. Mount the WinPE image:
   ```powershell
   dism /mount-wim /wimfile:"\\ServeurLDMS\ldmain\landesk\vboot\boot_x64.wim" /index:1 /mountdir:c:\mount
   ```
 
2. Inject the touchpad drivers:
   ```powershell
   Dism /Image:C:\mount /Add-Driver /Driver:"c:\WinPEDriversPbTouchPadx64" /Recurse
   ```

3. Commit and unmount:
   ```powershell
   Dism /unmount-wim /mountdir:c:\mount /commit
   ```
 
 ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes  
- Make sure the drivers in `c:\WinPEDriversPbTouchPadx64` are the correct ones for your HP model.  
- Always back up your original `boot.wim` before modification.
