# Active Setup Example â€“ Screensaver

This project is a **simple Active Setup example** that demonstrates how to register a per-user action during login.  

In this case, the example installs a **screensaver configuration** using:
- `ActiveSetup.reg` â†’ Registry template for Active Setup  
- `install.bat` â†’ Installation script  
- `ScreenSaver.bat` â†’ Example payload executed for each user  

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The goal is to provide a **minimal working sample** showing how Active Setup can deploy or configure settings (like a screensaver) for all users automatically at logon.
